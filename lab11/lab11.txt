\f0\fs24 \cf0 Homework 1:\
	I changed the andriodx.appcompat:appcompat version from 1.0.2 to 1.1.0.\
	I changed the android:test:runner version from 1.1.1 to 1.2.0.\
	I changed the version of Android.test.espreso:espresso:espresso-core from 3.1.1 to 3.2.0.\
	For text sizes in activity_main.xml I changed it from \'93dp\'94 to \'93sp\'94.\
	I extracted string for \'93Value 1\'94, \'93Value 2\'94, \'93Operator\'94 and \'93Operators\'94 from activity_main.xml instead of hardcoding it\
	I made all the variable declarations private in MainActivity.\
	In MainActivity , I changed the spelling in the comment of MainActivity from \'93mainactivity\'94\
	I chose not to change the spelling of my name because it was giving me a warning on that. \
	I also chose not to add the autofill hints in my EditText boxes because it was not necessary. \
	I also not to change the spelling of one of the id name even though the checker was giving me 	a misspelling warning because I thought it was not necessary. \
	There was no coding problem. \
